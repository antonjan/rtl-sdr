This version has been modified by HA7ILM to include password protection.
If the "-l password" switch is supplied, the client starts to get the I/Q samples only after sending the correct password over the socket.

Known problems:
- Password is sent plain-text by now. It's not secure, but better than no authentication at all.
- Dongle identifier is sent back before authentication, password only protects the I/Q samples.
- Please use adequately long passwords.
- This feature has been added for support in a later version of OpenWebRX.
